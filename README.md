# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to browse a list or map of UofT landmarks so that I can see what places I can visit and learn more about each one.
2. As a user, I want to “check in” to a location so that my visit is recorded in my passport.
3. As a user, I want to view my overall progress (e.g., number of landmarks visited, a filled passport, or a colour-coded map) so that I can track my exploration achievements.
4. As a user, I want to plan a route that visits multiple landmarks so that I can efficiently explore several locations in one trip.
5. As a user, I want to leave private notes or reflections on places I’ve visited so that I can remember experiences or tips.
6. As a user, I want to view public notes or recommendations left by others so that I can discover interesting or lesser-known spots
