# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

Project Overview: 
Gacha Pets.
The project is a tradable card game where players can get random pets from blind boxes and keep the pets in their collection. Players can interact with their pets. And between players, pet cards are tradable.
 (Add a summary of what we are trying to make)
User Stories:
- As a player, I want to have a collection of cards of their pets. 
- As a player, I want to use pet coins to buy a new random pet from a gacha blind box system with 0 affection and add it to my collection.
- As a player, I want to increase the affection of my pet with me by feeding, petting, and playing with them. 
- As a player, I want to check my collections and check each of my pet cards with the name, rarity, description, picture, and affection.
- As a player, I want to interact with my pet to increase the affection of my pet for me. (Feed it when it is hungry, pet it, and play with it.)
- As a player, I want to trade my pet cards with another player.
- As a player, I want to increase the affection with my pet when doing positive interactions (e.g., feed it when it is hungry, pet it, play with it) and decrease the affection with it when doing negative interactions (e.g., feed it when it is full, play when it is tired).
- As a player, I want to see my petâ€™s mood change after interactions (hungry and tired after play, full after feeding) and time passed (hungry after 1 min, energetic after tired for 10 sec). 
- As a player, I want to get rewards of pet coins by rarity when I have a pet with 100% affection.
