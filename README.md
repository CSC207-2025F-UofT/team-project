# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.

October 2nd:
We discussed project ideas in the second half of lec. We decided the Course Ratings System and Social Media App seem the best. Our project can be a UofT Social Media app for students, which has a course ratings system feature as well

Some ideas that appealed to us:
UofT Course Ratings System
Stats Reporter for Sports Team
Social Media App
Game App: Connect 4
Chess and Checkers
From a GUI perspective, we should be able to implement our project via Swing.
Our project needs to incorporate an external API to get some data.
I'm not sure where we would need an API if we do Connect 4 / any other board game (maybe have an AI player?) but the others would all fit in well.
(Scrape data from reddit etc for course ratings, api from stats databases for sports, backend api to store social media data)
We don't want to do something where we have very little logic (e.g. Weather App using backend API, Recipe Maker via backend API) because we're not doing anything fun in that
