**Use case 1:** Track expenses

* **Main flow:**
    * User enters the amount for the type of expense
    * The system stores transactions under the user’s profile
* **Alternative flow:**
    * Duplicate entry → undo transaction
    * Invalid or empty input → prompt user to enter amount in correct format

**Use case 2**: Financial trends

* **Main flow:**
    * Choose the type of time range (view by day, by week, or by month).
    * System displays user’s financial history using line chart
* **Alternative flow:**
    * Not enough entries → prompt “not enough information” to show

**Use case 3:** Fetch Selected Live Stock prices

* **Main flow:**
    * User enters the name of the stock in the search bar.
    * Fetch and display the list of related stock symbols.
    * User selects the stock symbol that they are interested in.
    * System shows the current line chart of the selected stock.
    * User can view the chart by selecting different time ranges.
    * User can hover their cursor on the line chart and it would show the price at the timestamp
* **Alternative flow:**
    * Network stability issues/API call failure → System shows warning and displays last-loaded prices; label the chart “as of \<timestamp\>.”
    * Invalid symbol in the search bar → display “No results for “what user just entered”

**Use Case 4:** Investing in Simulated Market

    * User chooses either buy or sell, and then enters the amount and clicks submit.
    * Show the latest price
    * Update the holdings, lots and simulated money amount
    * Recalculated the profit or loss
* **Alternative flow:**
    * No recent price available (e.g., off the market or internet stability issues) after clicking the submit button → ask user to refresh the market
    * Not enough simulated money → notify the user “Not enough money” and show user a button to add more simulated money if they want

**Use Case 5:** Portfolio performance diagnostics

* **Main flow:**
    * User clicks “stock holdings”
    * System fetches portfolio gain/loss over time

    * System displays a line chart of the gain/loss of investment over time, and also overall percent increase/decrease in returns
    * System displays all invested stock options stacked vertically with current price of stock, gain/loss, holding amount of portfolio
* **Alternative flow:**
    * Network stability issue with fetching historical data → prompt to refresh
    * New users have not invested at all and opened it → display “No data available”

**Use Case 6:** Real-time News

* **Main flow:**
    * User can directly see the latest news headlines at the top of the home page for their holdings and watchlist

#### **Proposed API**

Alpha Vantage  
[https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

* For our use case 3: “Fetch Selected Live Stock Prices”, we would use the Ticker Search (SYMBOL\_SEARCH) from this api to help us display correct symbol results.  When the user types a company name or symbol letter, the list will return the best-match symbols.
* We would use TIME\_SERIES\_DAILY, TIME\_SERIES\_WEEKLY, TIME\_SERIES\_MONTHLY to help us view the line chart of Stock performance
* We also use NEWS\_SENTIMENT from this API to fetch real-time news
* We would also use GLOBAL\_QUOTE from this API to return the latest price and volume information for selected symbol.
