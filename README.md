# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.

Our homepage displays any tasks with upcoming due dates, as well as SOMETHING?
There is a bar on the side of the homepage that will bring you to various pages and features of our program: Calendar, and Task Manager

HOME PAGE
As a user, I want to be able to see what tasks I have due soon on the home page, so I know what to prioritize whenever I open the application.
As a user, I want to be taken back to the homepage whenever I select the Home button.

TASK MANAGER
(ELLA) As a user, when I select Task Manager I want to see all of my courses and their respective todo-lists laid out so I can see how much needs to be done.
As a user, I want to be able to add each of my courses to the task manager so I can make a separate todo list for each course.
As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, and remove tasks from my todo lists, so I can adjust my lists if needed.
As a user, I want to be able to set a due date for each assignment.

CALENDAR
As a user, I want to be able to add assignments and other events to my calendar so I can visually see what needs to be done.

LOGIN/LOGOUT
As a user, I want my todo lists and calendar to be saved when I logout of the application, so I don't lose track of my schedule.

API's
no idea lol
