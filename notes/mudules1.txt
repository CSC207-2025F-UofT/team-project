{"text":"Based on the provided PDFs for course PHL245, the term \"modules\" does not appear as a topic of study or a concept within the course content (Modern Symbolic Logic). The course description, weekly schedule, and recommended texts focus on sentential logic and predicate logic, including arguments, semantics, symbolization, and derivation techniques.\n\nThe word \"module\" is used once in the context of \"Additional Logic2010 Installation Instructions in the Course Resources **module** in Quercus\" (page 2), which refers to a section or organizational unit on the Quercus online learning platform, not a philosophical or logical concept to be taught.\n\nTherefore, I cannot create lecture notes on \"modules\" using only the attached PDFs, as the topic is not covered in the course material provided.","highlights":[]}
