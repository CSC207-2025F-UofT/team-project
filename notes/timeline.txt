Course Structure \u0026 Progression\n\n*   **Course Duration:** Spans 12 academic weeks, incorporating a Reading Week, and concludes with a Final Exam period.\n*   **Logic Progression:**\n    *   **First Half:** Dedicated to Sentential Logic (Units 1-4).\n    *   **Second Half:** Expands to Predicate Logic (Units 5-9).\n*   **Learning Cycle:** The semester generally follows a pattern of three weeks of learning new material, culminating in an in-class test. This cycle repeats four times.\n*   **Online Videos:** Lecture and demonstration videos are \"frontloaded\"—meaning there are typically more videos to watch in the first week of a learning section, fewer in the second, and very few in the third.\n\n### 2. Weekly Activities \u0026 Deadlines\n\n*   **Synchronous Sessions:**\n    *   **Wednesday 1-3 PM:** Online via Zoom for brief material review, problem practice, and student Q\u0026A.\n    *   **Friday 2-3 PM:** This one-hour slot is used for **four in-person tests** throughout the semester. Other Fridays are typically designated as \"No Class.\"\n*   **Online Videos:** Students are expected to watch assigned lecture and demonstration videos weekly, preferably early in the week, prior to synchronous sessions.\n*   **Weekly Quizzes:**\n    *   **Frequency:** 12 weekly online quizzes.\n    *   **Platform:** Quiz 1 is on Quercus; Quizzes 2-12 are on Logic2010.\n    *   **Due Date:** Typically due Friday night each week.\n    *   **Late Submissions:** Accepted up to 48 hours past the due date with a 50% penalty. No submissions are accepted after 48 hours.\n\n### 3. Major Assessments Timeline\n\n*   **Four In-Class Tests (55% total, 13.75% each):**\n    *   Each 50-minute test is held during the Friday 2-3 PM in-person slot.\n    *   Test locations are announced on Quercus.\n*   **12 Weekly Online Quizzes (10% total, 0.83% each):** See details above under \"Weekly Activities \u0026 Deadlines.\"\n*   **Final Exam (35%):**\n    *   **Timing:** Takes place during the examination week at the end of the semester.\n    *   **Duration:** Three hours.\n    *   **Content:** Cumulative, covering all course material.\n\n### 4. Tentative Weekly Schedule\n\n*   **Week 1 (Sept 3, 5):** Introduction; Unit 1: Arguments; Unit 1 continued; Unit 2 Semantics.\n*   **Week 2 (Sept 10, 12):** Unit 2 continued; Unit 3 Symbolization; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 3 (Sept 17, 19):** Unit 3 continued; **Test 1 (Units 1-3)**.\n*   **Week 4 (Sept 24, 26):** Unit 4: Derivations in Sentential Logic; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 5 (Oct 1, 3):** Units 3 and 4 continued; **Test 2 (Units 3 and 4)**.\n*   **Week 6 (Oct 8, 10):** Unit 5: Single-Place Symbolization in Predicate Logic; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 7 (Oct 15, 17):** Unit 6: Single-Place Derivations in Predicate Logic; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 8 (Oct 22, 24):** Units 5 and 6 continued; **Test 3 (Units 5 and 6)**.\n*   **Reading Week:** Occurs after Week 8.\n*   **Week 9 (Nov 5, 7):** Unit 7: Multi-Place Symbolization in Predicate Logic; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 10 (Nov 12, 14):** Unit 8: Multi-Place Derivations in Predicate Logic; No Class (Friday).\n*   **Week 11 (Nov 19, 21):** Units 7 and 8 continued; **Test 4 (Units 7 and 8)**.\n*   **Week 12 (Nov 26, 28):** Unit 9: Semantics in Predicate Logic; No Class. **Make-Up Test (Units 1-8)** (Friday).\n\n### 5. Policy-Related Timelines\n\n*   **Test Regrade Requests:** Must be submitted via an MS Form on Quercus within **seven days** of the test\u0027s return.\n*   **Missed Test Policy:**\n    *   Request approval for a make-up test by filling out the \"Missed Test Form\" on Quercus.\n    *   Must be done within **seven days** of the missed test (a shorter window applies for Test 4).\n    *   A single, cumulative make-up test covering Units 1-8 will be held at the end of the semester.\n*   **Missed Final Exam:** Contact the Registrar\u0027s office **immediately**.","highlights":[]}
