Watch demonstrations multiple times.\n*   **Do Not Fall Behind:** Course material is cumulative; consistent understanding is crucial.\n*   **Practice Consistently:** Engage with logic problems almost daily, practicing a variety of types and difficulties.\n*   **Learn From Mistakes:** Analyze incorrect solutions to understand errors rather than simply moving to the next problem.\n*   **Utilize All Resources:** Leverage Piazza, Logic2010 practice, online videos, office hours, Logic Lab, and peer collaboration.\n*   **Use Pencil and Paper in Class:** Recommended for taking notes and working through problems to simulate test conditions (digital notes will be provided).","highlights":[]}
