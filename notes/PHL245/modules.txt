{"text":"## PHL245: Modern Symbolic Logic - Modules Overview\n\nThis course (PHL245H) provides an introduction to first-order logic, divided into two main parts: Sentential Logic and Predicate Logic. The content is structured into distinct modules (referred to as \"Units\" in the course schedule).\n\n### Course Goals \u0026 Skills Developed\n*   **Goal:** Master formal logic.\n*   **Skills:** Significantly develop abstract reasoning and argument analysis abilities, leading to improved critical reading, writing, and thinking.\n\n### Part 1: Sentential Logic Modules\n\nThe first half of the course focuses on sentential logic, introducing foundational concepts and techniques.\n\n*   **Module 1: Arguments (Unit 1)**\n    *   Introduction to the structure and nature of logical arguments.\n*   **Module 2: Semantics (Units 2 \u0026 9 - Note: Unit 9 is Predicate Logic Semantics)**\n    *   Covers the meaning and interpretation of logical expressions within sentential logic.\n*   **Module 3: Symbolization (Unit 3)**\n    *   Focuses on translating natural language arguments and statements into formal logical symbols.\n*   **Module 4: Derivations in Sentential Logic (Unit 4)**\n    *   Introduces techniques for constructing formal proofs and deductions within sentential logic.\n\n### Part 2: Predicate Logic Modules\n\nThe second half of the course expands upon sentential logic skills, applying them to predicate logic.\n\n*   **Module 5: Single-Place Symbolization in Predicate Logic (Unit 5)**\n    *   Extends symbolization skills to predicate logic, focusing on propositions involving single properties or relations.\n*   **Module 6: Single-Place Derivations in Predicate Logic (Unit 6)**\n    *   Applies derivation techniques to predicate logic, specifically for single-place predicates.\n*   **Module 7: Multi-Place Symbolization in Predicate Logic (Unit 7)**\n    *   Further develops symbolization for predicate logic, encompassing propositions with multiple properties or relations.\n*   **Module 8: Multi-Place Derivations in Predicate Logic (Unit 8)**\n    *   Expands derivation skills to handle multi-place predicates in formal proofs.\n*   **Module 9: Semantics in Predicate Logic (Unit 9)**\n    *   Explores the meaning and interpretation of expressions within predicate logic, building on earlier semantic concepts.","highlights":[]}
