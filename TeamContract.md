# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### a) Communication

* Our agreed point of communication is Discord. Specifically, we will communicate in the group chat we have made with all team members. 

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages within 12 hours, barring unforeseen circumstances such as medical or familial incidents. 

* Each teammate agrees to notify the team if they are unable to attend a lecture or tutorial, unable to meet a deadline for their portion of the project, or if there are any emergencies that impact their work or response time.

* Each teammate agrees to respect the dignity and value of every other teammate by giving a fair chance to their ideas and viewpoints, appreciating and acknowledging their contributions to the project, and tolerating differing opinions within the team.

### b) Academic Integrity

* Each team member agrees not to take any action which would violate Academic Integrity guidelines.

* Each team member acknowledges that Academic Dishonesty would not only implicate themself, but would also tarnish the academic and professional reputation of the entire team.

* Prohibited behaviour includes, but is not limited to, the use of generative AI or copying code from an external source without proper citation.

### c) Peer Evaluations

* Each team member agrees to be fair, balanced, and unbiased during peer evaluations.

* No team member will make a peer evaluation based on any personal conflicts or biases that are irrelevant to CSC207, and will only evaluate a team member's performance and conduct within the scope of this course.

### d) Mutual Respect

* Each team member agrees to make every reasonable effort to ensure their teammates feel valued and included.

* Each team member will try their best to assist any teammate who is in need.

* No team member will disrespect or belittle another teammate due to honest and reasonable mistakes or inexperience with a particular topic.

## Decision Making

* Major project decisions will be made after consulting the entire team in-person or via the Discord group chat (our agreed point of communication).

* Unanimous consent will be required for any major team decision to be made. With this in mind, each team member agrees to make fair and reasonable compromises during discussions regarding decisions.

* Exception: A team member is free to make a decision regarding a portion of the project that has been delegated to them without any consultation, but is encouraged to ask the team for input in any case.

---
## Conflict resolution

* Our team agrees to resolve conflicts of ideas and/or proposals as follows: Supposing we have ideas A and B in conflict,
  1) Everyone who supports idea A must be able to sufficiently articulate idea B so that those who support B agree that A supporters understand idea B. The same will be done for idea A, so that both sides know that everyone sufficiently understands each idea.
  2) If the issue cannot be resolved by discussion following step (i), we agree to seek a TA or Instructor for advice.
  3) Ultimately, conflicts will be resolved with recourse to the "Decision Making" section outlined above.
* Out team agrees that conflicts not pertaining to ideas and/or proposals for the project will ideally be resolved through open and honest discussion, as best as can be carried out.

---

## Accountability

* Each team member is responsible for completing their work within the agreed-upon timeframe.

* Each team member is responsible for quality assurance of any portion of the project they contribute to (notably, testing their code). 

* Each team member agrees to ensure readability of any code they write, especially in regards to variable and method names, comments, and whitespace/indentations.
