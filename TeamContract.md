# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will primarily use Instagram for communicating within the whole group. 

* Everyone should respond to messages in the group chat in 24 hours unless for exceptional circumstances. Also check the issues in github!

* If someone is stuck on an issue(bugs, concepts etc.), they can notify the team using the ISSUE in github.
* Let others know if you can’t attend the lab on instagram.
* If a deadline won’t be met, the team should additionally be notified through the instagram group at least 24 hours before the deadline.
* Update the Shared document (the final project one) about the following:
* PR: when you are making the pull request, you should write down what you did in that PR, and just copy that into our shared document.
* Progress: 
* Meeting: We could hold some meetings(in-person/Zoom), just take some notes about the meeting.
* Ideas: Because we will separate the project, please write down any ideas about your part inu the document and write the comment in your code to let others know what the method and classes are for.

* Team members should try to seek input from everyone else before making a decision. Every member should not put down or ignore someone else’s ideas.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

## Decision Making

* Decisions about the team project will be made by voting and some compromises. A unanimous vote should try to be reached, but if compromises cannot form a unanimous agreement, we will use a majority vote.

---
## Conflict resolution

* We will be respectful when issues arise and listen to each other's side of the issue to try and find a compromise. Alternatively, a conflict might need to be resolved by consulting the team or a TA when trying to find a solution. 

---

## Accountability

* Every member should try to complete their work on time, ask for help as soon as it’s needed, and communicate to the team often regarding their progress and obstacles. The team should be understanding and help each other whenever it’s required.
