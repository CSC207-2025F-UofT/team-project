# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

We will primarily communicate through our Instagram group chat.

All teammates will respond to messages after at most a day to ensure that communication remains consistent.

Teammates should notify each other as soon as they believe that they are unable to make a deadline. Teammates should also notify each other when they are unable to attend a lab.

Teammates will actively listen to each others ideas and meaningfully contribute to all discussions.

---

## Decision Making


Any large-scale architecture choices must be made unaninimously so that all members understand their role. All other choices (implementation, coding, etc) can be made instead by majority rule if an opinion cannot be settled on.

---

## Conflict resolution

Teammates will try their best to be empathetic and listen to both sides when facing a compromise. If a compromise cannot be reached internally, then a TA will be consulted to help resolve the issue.

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
  - complete your share of the work,make it clear if u cant make the deadline day in advance.

All members will be expected to be able to complete their work independently. If a member cannot make an agreed upon deadline for the project or a component of a project, they must make it clear to everyone else at least a day in advance.
