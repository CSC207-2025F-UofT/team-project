## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Instagram as our primary communication channel.
* Team members will respond to messages within **24** hours on weekdays. Messages sent on weekends should be responded **no later than the end of Monday**.
* Each team member should provide **at least one progress update per week** regarding their share of the work for the group project, even if no progress has been made, or if they have encountered some difficulties.
* Teammates should notify the group if they have to miss a lab, or encounter any obstacles that may affect their responsibilities.
* Actively listen to each team member’s ideas.
Give everyone an equal opportunity to contribute meaningfully. Maintain a respectful tone at all times and avoid interrupting others. Assume good intentions and seek clarification rather than jumping to conclusions.

### Attendance & Participation

* Members will attend all scheduled labs and team meatings unless illness or emergencies occur.
* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance (and provide input asynchronously when needed).
---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.
* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.
---
## Conflict resolution
* Team members will first attempt to resolve conflicts by listening to each other’s perspectives and discussing possible compromises.
* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

---

## Accountability
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
* All members are welcome to seek assistance from other teammates when required.
