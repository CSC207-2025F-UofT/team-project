## Purpose of this Contract

It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We shall use text messages for communication outside of class, when we are required for work on your course project?

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most 24 hours since the message was sent, unless deadlines cause it to be more imperative (i.e. respond to a question about a deadline in 4 hours at most 4 hours after it was sent)

* A teammate should notify the team about:
  * If they are having any trouble with their piece of the code,
  * Whether they need help with their portion, and
  * If they think they will be unable to meet a required deadline, they should let the team know so we can work accordingly.

* We shall use respectful and inclusive behaviour for smooth and productive communication. 
  * Contributing to group conversations and important decisions about group tasks, and
  * Asking questions when uncertain about a task and generally helping one another when possible.

---
## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
  * When a decision needs to be made, each member will offer their choices, and as a team, we will make a decision based on all the choices discussed, in the form of a plurality vote, where the most popular option is picked. 
  * In cases where thereâ€™s still conflict after discussion, there will be attempts happen to fuse the most popular options.

---
## Conflict resolution

* The team will resolve conflicts through:
  * If a conflict were to arise we will listen to one other and as a group find the best suited compromise. 
  * If there is no good compromise, we shall go to a vote or consult a TA.

---
## Accountability

* Each team member is responsible for:
  * Being assigned tasks,
  * Complete assigned tasks on the given timeline,
  * Making sure all parts of the project are being completed on time (checking in) on others,
