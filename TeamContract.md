# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* The team will use Instagram as its primary communication platform. All members agree to check and respond to messages requiring a reply by 11:00 p.m. each day.
  Mentions (@) should be used only when work-related communication is necessary. Members are also required to check the email linked to GitHub daily and report completed and pending tasks every Saturday evening.

*
* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

## Decision Making
* This team would follow the form of voting when making decisions, since there is 5 people there would always be a exact outcome. However, if the vote is very close such as 2:3, it is possible that further discussion may happen such that one group would
* try to convince the other such that we can avoid conflict.

## Conflict resolution

* when conflicts occur, we would  try our best to work it out, listen to what others have to say, be patient. If conflicts cannot be resolved, we would seek help of others such as TA or professor 
* Members agree to push their code only to their own branch and always open a pr before merge.
* When coding conflict occur, 4 out of 5 people need to look at the code and decide which version should we keep or further modifications are needed.
* Members agree to follow the above procedure. The responsibility for code conflicts is evenly distributed between two individuals who will need to work together to meet the team's schedule

## Accountability

* this team would be expected to show up in tutorials, if not, there should be a valid reason such as: overwelming loads of work, test, or other problems. If team member decides not to show up, they would have to inform all the group members by instagram, and would have to make
* up by doing the assigned group work discussed by group members present to the tutorial. This is same for lectures where there is iRat, team members are expected to show up on days where we have to collaborate as a team.
