# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Preparation

* Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

* Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (e.g., lower peer evaluation scores).

### Communication

* We will continue using Instagram as our primary method of communication. 

* Each teammate agrees to try to respond to messages as soon as they can. When possible, this should be within 24 hours (i.e. holidays are an exception).

* Members are also expected to let groupmates know if they're stuck or need an extra opinion relating to their portion of the group project. They understand that failing to complete expected contributions on time may lead to reduced peer evaluation scores.

### Participation

* Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur. Notice of at least an hour is expected when possible. 

* Teammates are expected to listen actively to ideas and allow everyone the chance to contribute to discussions.

* Members should provide constructive feedback when requested by a teammate (i.e. ensure the person wants to receive feedback, and that feedback is worded in a way that doesn't degrade the person).

### Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

### Work Quality

* All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

* Members agree to review each other’s work constructively before submission.

* At least two team members will review each Pull Request.

## Conflict resolution

If conflict arises:

1. The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.

2. If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as a mediator.

---
## Accountability

* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
