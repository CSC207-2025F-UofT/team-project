# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

 - We aren't able to attend a lecture, tutorial or team meeting.
 - We are facing troubles with our part of the work.
 - We do not fully understand what certain parts of the code means.

## Decision Making

We will try to aim for a unanimous vote if possible, otherwise we will go with supermajority (majority is at least 2x minority).

## Conflict resolution

Should there be conflicts within the team, we will do our best to remain open minded and listening to each party's perspectives and views. We then will try to reach a conclusion accepted by vote (see decision making), and should there be further issues or strong feelings, we will consult those we believe to be appropriate, ie. TAs, instructors, stakeholders.

- We will finish the tasks we've taken on / that are assigned to us.
- We will notify our team at least 24 hours in advance should we be unable to fulfill our responsibilities.
