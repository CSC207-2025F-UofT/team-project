# Team Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---

# Preperation

Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class. Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (e.g., lower peer evaluation scores).
# Communication

We will use Discord as our primary communication channel. Team members will respond to messages within 8 hours on weekdays. All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.
# Attendance and Preperation

Members will attend a majority of scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur. If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously. During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and engage in the discussion.
# Decision Making

Decisions will be made by consensus when possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.
# Work Quality 

All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard. Members agree to review each other’s work constructively before submission. Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.

If conflict arises:
The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.
If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.
Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores. All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
