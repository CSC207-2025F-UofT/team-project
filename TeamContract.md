# Team Contract

---

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

-   Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)

We will use Discord as our primary communication platform for project-related discussions and coordination.

-   Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?

Each team member commits to responding to messages within 24 hours during weekdays and within 48 hours on weekends, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

-   What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

Team members should notify the group about:

-   Inability to meet deadlines or need for deadline extensions
-   Missing lectures, labs, or scheduled team meetings
-   Technical difficulties that may impact their contribution
-   Personal circumstances that may affect their availability
-   Any concerns about the project direction or team dynamics

*   Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

We expect all team members to:

-   Actively listen to each other's ideas without interruption
-   Give everyone equal opportunity to contribute and share their thoughts
-   Provide constructive feedback rather than criticism
-   Respect different perspectives and working styles
-   Use inclusive language and avoid making assumptions
-   Be patient with teammates who may need additional explanation or support

### Work Distribution and Scheduling

-   Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?

We agree to:

-   Divide work equitably based on each member's strengths and availability
-   Set realistic deadlines with buffer time for unexpected issues
-   Meet regularly (at least once per week) to discuss progress and address concerns
-   Share knowledge and help each other learn new concepts or technologies
-   Maintain a shared document or project board to track progress and responsibilities
-   Conduct regular check-ins to ensure everyone is on track and address any blockers
-   Celebrate achievements and milestones together as a team

---

## Decision Making

-   How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)

Decisions will be made through discussion and consensus whenever possible. For major project decisions (such as technology choices, project scope, or significant design changes), we will aim for unanimous agreement. For smaller decisions or when consensus cannot be reached after thorough discussion, we will use majority vote. If a decision significantly affects one team member's work area, their input will be given extra consideration.

---

## Conflict Resolution

-   How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)

When conflicts arise, we will:

1. Address issues promptly and directly with the involved parties
2. Listen to all perspectives with an open mind and without judgment
3. Focus on the issue at hand rather than personal characteristics
4. Work together to find a mutually acceptable compromise or solution
5. If the conflict cannot be resolved within the team, we will consult a TA or instructor for guidance
6. Document any agreements reached to prevent future misunderstandings
7. Maintain professional relationships regardless of disagreements

---

## Accountability

-   Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)

Each team member is responsible for:

-   Completing their assigned tasks on time and to the agreed-upon quality standards
-   Communicating proactively about progress, challenges, and potential delays
-   Attending scheduled team meetings and being punctual
-   Coming prepared to meetings with updates and any necessary materials
-   Seeking help from teammates, TAs, or instructors when facing difficulties
-   Reviewing and providing constructive feedback on teammates' work
-   Contributing equally to the overall project effort
-   Maintaining the quality and integrity of shared code and documentation
-   Being honest about their capabilities and workload limitations
-   Taking ownership of mistakes and working to resolve them quickly
