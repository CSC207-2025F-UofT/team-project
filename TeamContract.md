## Team Norms & Expectations

### Communication
- **Primary platform:** Instagram
- **Urgent backup:** Text or email if Discord is unavailable.
- **Response time:** Within **24 hours** (weekdays); within **36 hours** on weekends/holidays if not time-critical.
- **Notify the team if:**
    - You will miss a meeting/lab/lecture.
    - You may miss a milestone/deadline.
    - You are blocked or facing personal/technical issues.
- **Respect & inclusion:**
    - Actively listen; avoid interruptions; invite quieter voices.
    - Keep language professional and kind; assume good intent.
    - Give/receive feedback specifically and respectfully.
    - Summarize decisions in writing (Discord) after discussions.

### Work Quality & Collaboration
- Contribute **reliably and proportionally** to scope.
- Follow team code standards (naming, comments, tests, formatting).
- Use feature branches; open **PRs** early; keep PRs reasonably scoped.
- Every PR requires **at least one review** and passing tests before merge.
- If unsure, **ask early** (teammates/TA) rather than blocking progress.

### Meetings
- **Cadence:** At least once per week during active milestones.
- **Preparation:** Come with updates, blockers, and next steps.
- **Notes:** Record decisions, action items, and owners in Discord.

---

## Decision Making
- Discuss options, trade-offs, and constraints openly.
- **Default rule:** **Majority vote** after everyone is heard.
- **High-impact decisions** (architecture, scope changes): strive for **consensus**; if not feasible, document rationale and proceed by majority.

---

## Conflict Resolution
1. Address concerns **promptly and privately** with those involved; listen to understand.
2. If unresolved, bring to the **team** to explore options and compromises.
3. Persisting issues: **consult TA/instructor** together for mediation.
4. Maintain a constructive tone; focus on behaviours/outcomes, not people.

---

## Accountability
- **Each member will:**
    - Deliver assigned tasks **on time** and to an agreed standard.
    - Write tests where appropriate; keep docs/readmes updated.
    - Commit/push regularly with meaningful messages.
    - Proactively flag risks and request help when blocked.
- **If a deadline is missed without communication:**
    - Reassign or pair on the task; adjust scope if needed.
    - Document impact and mitigation; escalate to TA if recurring.

### Academic Integrity
- Follow course policies and U of T academic integrity guidelines.
- Cite all external sources and libraries per assignment rules.

This contract may be updated by **unanimous agreement** if team needs evolve. Changes must be recorded in this file and noted in Discord.
