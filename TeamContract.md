# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Discord to communicate - all communications should be put into the correct channel and mention the right person
* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages by the next weekday — unless extenuating circumstances. For more urgent situations, call using phone number directly.
* If you do not understand an instruction or task assigned, ask about it immediately
* If an explicit task and deadline is assigned, and you cannot meet the said deadline, then inform group members at least 2 days in advance
* If we schedule a meeting, then you are expected to show up and if you cannot show up, inform at least 2 days in advance
* Don't argue over disagreements and try resolve them amicably
* Let everyone voice their opinion on decision made on behalf of the group
* Try be respectful and positive

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

## Code Quality
* Only open pull requests from completed features
* Complete tasks by the internal deadlines
* At least two members review each PR before merging it into the main branch
* All code should meet codebase standards (matching agreed name conventions, documented well with comments, follow CLEAN architecture)
* Preferably document why each decision is made
* All code that you submit you must understand fully and be able to explain why and how it works
* Commit frequently and in separate branches; work on the main branch in rare circumstances
* If you submit code but you know that it can be optimised, just work on it after commit (optional)

## Group Meetings
* We will have 2-3 group meetings during the project to be held in-person (one at the start of the project, one at the end before submission and one in between)
* Everyone should show up to group meetings (inform 2 days ahead for rescheduling of group meeting)
* While at the meeting, everyone should be focussed on solving the issue at hand and not working on other course work

## Decision Making

* Preliminary stage of decision making will be a vote: preliminary decision will only proceed as final if 4/5 group members agree
* If the group is conflicted between two or more decisions, we will get together to analyse and express opinions. After analysis, we will do an anonymous vote together and majority will proceed.

---
## Conflict resolution
* If there is a conflict, first try resolve it by speaking in-person and understnding situation
* Upon failure to resolve, then bring up the issue to the team and then the team will analyse the situation and determines the correct resolution
* Upon further failure to resolve after being brought up to team, the two members should talk directly with a TA or instructor

## Accountability

* Meet the deadline and unless you have a really good reason to miss it (otherwise, contributions will be deducted on peer evaluation)
* If a function is broken or buggy and you were in charge, then you are in charge of fixing it (does not count if a function that you depend on does not work as intended)
* You are fine to ask for help on advice or writing one or two of lines of code, beyond that, the credit for the function goes equally to the person working on it
* All work will be equally shared first; after the deadline, then if you have not completed the work, others can help you for credit; before the deadline of the project, everyone agrees to help everyone on each other's task
* Before the deadline, do not modify other people's code and let them have a chance to contribute
