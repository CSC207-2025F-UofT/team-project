# Team Contract

## Purpose of this Contract
This contract establishes our shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate throughout the course. Our goal is to maintain accountability, professionalism, and mutual respect while completing all project components. We aim to ensure that communication is consistent, responsibilities are shared fairly, and all team members contribute meaningfully to our collective success.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication
- **Platform:** The team will communicate primarily through **Discord** for daily discussions and updates, and **GitHub** for project-related coordination. Urgent messages may also be sent via text or email.
- **Response Time:** Each team member agrees to respond to messages within **48 hours**.
- **Notification Expectations:** Members must notify the team as soon as possible if:
    - They will miss a meeting, or lab.
    - They cannot meet a deadline or need assistance with their assigned task.
    - They encounter any issues that could affect project progress.
- **Respectful Communication:**
    - Listen actively and do not interrupt while others are speaking.
    - Provide constructive feedback respectfully.
    - Encourage participation from all members and value diverse perspectives.
    - Use inclusive language and maintain a supportive tone in all interactions.

---

### Collaboration and Work Habits
- Every team member is expected to **contribute fairly** to the workload and attend scheduled meetings.
- Members will **document progress** through GitHub commits and communicate regularly about task updates.
- Meetings will start and end on time; everyone should come prepared with progress updates or questions.
- Team members will **support each other** by sharing resources, reviewing each other’s code/work, and offering help when needed.
- Plagiarism or unapproved use of AI-generated content will not be tolerated; all contributions must be original and properly cited.

---

## Decision Making
- All major decisions (e.g., project direction, task allocation, deadlines) will be made by **majority vote** after discussion.
- If the team cannot reach a majority decision, we will **revisit the discussion** or consult a **TA or instructor** for guidance.
- Minor technical decisions (e.g., coding structure or formatting) may be made by the team member responsible for that section but should be communicated clearly to the group.

---

## Conflict Resolution
- Team members will first discuss any issues privately and respectfully to understand each other’s perspectives.
- If the issue remains unresolved, the matter will be brought to the entire team for open discussion and compromise.
- If necessary, the team will consult a **TA or instructor** to mediate and assist in finding a fair resolution.
- The team agrees to handle conflicts professionally, avoiding personal criticism and focusing on solutions.

---

## Accountability
- Each member is responsible for:
    - Completing assigned tasks on time and meeting quality expectations.
    - Communicating progress regularly and asking for help early when challenges arise.
    - Attending meetings, contributing ideas, and reviewing others’ work constructively.
- If a member repeatedly fails to meet expectations (e.g., missing deadlines, lack of communication), the issue will be discussed as a team. Persistent issues will be reported to the course staff if necessary.
- All team members are equally accountable for ensuring that the project meets course requirements and deadlines.

## Revision Policy
This contract may be updated if all team members agree. Any revisions must be recorded in GitHub, and all members must approve the updated version through a new Pull Request.
