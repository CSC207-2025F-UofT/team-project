## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* The main platform for communication is Instagram.

* Each teammate agrees to check and respond to messages in at least 1 day. (2 days at most.) 

* As a teammate, you are responsible for notifying others in cases of planned absences, emergencies, missed lectures, or scheduling conflicts.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. Be actively involved in the discussion and listen to each team members ideas, and don't be shy to share your own.

---

### Preparation

* Each team member must be familiar with the course material by completing the assigned readings and practicing before class.

* Members who find the material difficult agree to reach out to other teammates for help before the lecture.

---

### Responsibility and Accountability

* Every member must have a basic understanding of the whole project.

* All team members must be attentive when tasks are being divided. Be clear about what you will be working on.

* Each team member must first work on something they are confident about, rather than something they are unfamiliar with. (Once you have completed your task, you can move on to something more challenging!)

* Tasks must be completed on time, and meet basic standards (if it is code, it should work as intended, etc.).

* All Pull Requests should be reviewed by at least 2 members. (But every team member must make an attempt to review all Pull Requests! This will help you be familiar with the code at all times.)

* In the PR stage, members must provide constructive feedback on how the code can be improved/meet high standards.

* If any teammate is finding any particular task too difficult, they must reach out to the team as soon as possible.

* Keep updating README.md (goals/progress/project overview) as needed.

---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus.

* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken. (The majority vote will decide the next step)

---
## Conflict resolution

* If any conflicts arise, the team will first attempt to resolve the issue through discussion (All sides must be understanding of the others).

* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course staff as the mediator.
