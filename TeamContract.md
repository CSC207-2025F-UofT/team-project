# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will be using Instagram as our primary source of contact.

* Each teammate will respond to a message within 24 hours on both weekends and weekdays.

* Teammates will notify the other members if they are unable to attend a lab or lecture, if they are unable to complete their assigned tasks on time and if they are unable to meet for the group check-in session.

* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive. Teammates will not be disparaged for making errors.
---

### Preparation

* Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

* Each team member commits to reading the lab activity before meeting so the team can have more time for discussion and collaboration.

* Each team member will be prepared to discuss their latest developments at the team check-in sessions.

___

### Attendance and Preparation 

* Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.

* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously if they are able.

* During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and engage in the discussion.


---

### Decision Making

* When possible decisions will be made when all the members are in agreement.

* If the team is not all in agreement, those in majority will discuss with the other member(s) and try to design and approach that puts their appeal in consideration.

* If such an approach cannot be designed the team will proceed with majority rules.

---
## Conflict resolution

* If a conflict arises, the team will first attempt to resolve the issue amongst ourselves.

* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team, like an instructor or TA as a mediator.

* After the conflict is resolved the team will reflect on the experience and discuss how to prevent similar conflicts from occurring in the future.

---

## Accountability

* Team members are responsible for completing their assigned tasks in a timely manner and will notify the team of any reasons restricting them from doing so.

* Team members are responsible for seeking assistance from teammates or TA's when required.

* Team members are responsible for regularly checking Instagram for messages and announcements.

* Team members will remain attentive and quiet in lectures so that the entire team, and by extension, the entire class can have a peaceful learning environment.

* Team members are responsible for submitting material on the agreed quality standard and any substandard material will be reviewed by the member responsible.

* Failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
