## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use **Instagram** as our primary communication channel.
* Team members will respond to messages within **24** hours on weekdays. Messages sent on weekends should be responded **no later than the end of Monday**.
* Each team member should provide **at least one progress update per week** regarding their share of the work for the group project, even if no progress has been made, or if they have encountered some difficulties.
* Teammates should notify the group if they have to miss a lab, or encounter any obstacles that may affect their responsibilities.
* Actively listen to each team member’s ideas.
Give everyone an equal opportunity to contribute meaningfully. Maintain a respectful tone at all times and avoid interrupting others. Assume good intentions and seek clarification rather than jumping to conclusions. 
* As a general rule, we will respect peers. Feedback and ideas are always welcome, and provided as they are constructive and polite. Also, we’ll provide proper critiques. To ensure everyone’s voice is heard, we will always pause and ask if anyone has concerns/questions during meetings. Additionally, to ensure that all ideas are given full consideration, we will take them up one at a time and talk about them as a group. If time is an issue, we will write them down and go over them at our next meeting. If a member is speaking, the others are expected to listen actively and provide critiques after the person has finished speaking.

### Attendance & Participation

* Members will attend all scheduled labs and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.
* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance (and provide input asynchronously when needed).
* Before starting a task, we will create a list of all the components required to complete it. As a group, we will go around and identify which tasks each person would like to take on. If someone is especially busy, they will be assigned a lighter workload at that time. Work distribution will be considered across the entire semester, for instance, someone may contribute less first week but take on more responsibility in later weeks. If anyone needs help at any point, they should notify the group through our chat. We also plan to reassess task distribution after every milestone.
* If a meeting is scheduled, everyone is expected to show up in-person/virtually. If for whatever reason someone needs to join virtually, they are encouraged to open their camera and unmute themselves during discussion. Meetings will go over any issues, ideas, or reminders that are relevant. There’s no set expectation for how often people should speak up, but everyone is encouraged to share their ideas, raise concerns, and contribute to the discussion whenever they can. We’ll also make sure everyone has a chance to share their opinions.

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.
* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.
---
## Conflict resolution
* Team members will first attempt to resolve conflicts by listening to each other’s perspectives and discussing possible compromises.
* If we have a major disagreement on the project's direction, we'll make sure everyone gets a chance to explain their point of view without interruption. If we still can't decide, we will put it to a majority vote. If the team is evenly split or the issue is critical, we'll consult with the TA for a neutral opinion.

## Accountability
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
* All members are welcome to seek assistance from other teammates when required.
* Team members should briefly update their progress throughout the week and check tasks on the list regularly. If anyone will be absent, please let the team know as soon as possible, and also share the current task status and next steps so we stay on the same page. If someone is being unresponsive, we will first try to leave a friendly @mention on Instagram to remind the task due date and ask if they need help. If we are unable to contact them within 48 hours, we might consider distributing the work to keep things moving. However, everyone should be responsible for their assigned tasks and for catching up on any changes.
