# Team Contract

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Discord as our primary communication channel.
* Team members will respond to messages within 24 hours on weekdays.

* A teammate should notify when they are not able to attend lectures/labs 2 hours in advance.
* If a teammate won't be able to meet a deadline, they should notify the group 24 hours in advance.

* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive, including actively listening to each team members ideas and giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute.

## Decision Making
* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.
* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

---
## Conflict resolution
* If conflict arises:
* The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.
* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

## Accountability

* Members should complete their share of the work in a timely manner, and should seek assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required.
* Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.
* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team 2 hours in advance.
* If a teammate did not show up to lecture/lab, or fail to contribute to activities that are being graded, they would not be able to get that grade.
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
