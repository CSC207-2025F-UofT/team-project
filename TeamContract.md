# Team Contract

---

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Basics

Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

Members who come unprepared or attempt insubordination, agree to accept dire consequences determined by the team.

The finished project will be published under an open-source license (i.e. MIT), so each member of the group will be able to showcase on their profiles and resumes. 

---

### Communication

We will use Discord as our primary communication channel.

Team members will respond to messages within 48 hours on weekdays.

All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.

Members should communicate with one another proactively. They may send notifications about their attendance, provide insightful ideas, or anything as long as the previous rule is upheld.

---

### Attendance & Participation

Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.

If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously.

During team activities, every member should actively contribute ideas and engage in the discussion.

---

### Decision-Making

Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

If two members wish to implement the same feature, they get to split it 50/50 or compromise.

If consensus cannot be reached, a coding duel will take place. The team may veto the duel in exchange for a peaceful democratic vote to take place instead.

Each member may implement crazy ideas as long as they take full responsibility for their implementation and do not interfere with the overall project structure.

---

### Work Quality      

All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.      

Members agree to review each other’s work constructively before submission.     

Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.

AI slop (low quality AI code) will not be accepted, only OI (Organic Intelligence) created code is tolerable.

---

## Accountability

Everyone adheres to academic integrity, and all code that is committed should be verified by other team members to ensure that ChatGPT and other AI resources have not been abused.

Team members who do not finish their work within the provided timeframe should decide if they need to make up for lost time before the next meeting, including the additional work for the following meeting.

---

By signing below, we acknowledge and pledge our commitment to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
