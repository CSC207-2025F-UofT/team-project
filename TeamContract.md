# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
* Discord

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?
* Respond by the next weekday — unless extenuating circumstances. For more urgent situations, call using phone number directly.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
* If you do not understand an instruction or task assigned, ask about it immediately. If an explicit task and deadline is assigned, and you cannot meet the said deadline, then inform group members at least 2 days in advance; if we schedule a meeting, then you are expected to show up and if you cannot show up, inform ASAP

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
* Don't argue over disagreements; let everyone voice their opinion on decision made on behalf of the group; try be respectful and positive

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
* 4/5 to agree; if conflicted between two or more decisions, analyse together and do anonymous vote together

---
## Conflict resolution


* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
* If there is a conflict, first try resolve it by speaking in-person and understnding situation; if failure to resolve, then bring up to team and then team analyses situation and determines the correct resolution; if still fail to resolve, talk to TA

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
