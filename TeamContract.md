## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Our team is dedicated to use Discord as a primary means of communication.

* Each team member is expected to response to another member's message within 1 day if the content of the message is considered urgent (i.e. by using the keyword "ASAP"). Otherwise, it is expected to response within 3 days maximum.

* As an inclusive and professional team, every team member is expected to remain respectful to others, create constructive arguments and criticisms, and retain the professionalism within team discussions.

---

### Attendance and Participation

* All members are expected to attend all scheduled lectures and tutorials unless illness or emergency occurs.

* In case of an emergency that a team member is unable to attend the tutorial and/or lecture, they are expected to notify the entire team in the group chat and state their reasoning.

* During team activities, all team members are expected to engage and contribute ideas in the discussion.
---

## Decision Making

* For general purposes, decisions will be made based on team consensus.
  - If no consensus can be reached, a poll will be conducted in the group chat, where the majority of votes rules.

---
## Conflict resolution

* If a conflict occurs, one (or more) team member(s) may become the mediator.
  - The mediator(s) will listen to both parties' issues and attempt to reach a compromise.
  - If no resolution has yet been reached, the entire team is required to consult either a TA or an instructor regarding the conflict.

## Accountability

* Every team member is expected to complete the share of their work within the given deadline.

* If a team member requires any form of assistance, they are expected to seek out another team member and/or a TA/an instructor.

* Failure to participate persistently and meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members shall agree to provide honest and fair responses in the peer evaluations.
