# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Communication will be done on Instagram.
* Max response time should be one day.
* Things to be notified about: Deadlines, Work progress, Lecture/Tutorial attendance.
* Basic conversation etiquette includes: Listening to others, building on other people's ideas (don't ignore what people say), not sharing for too long (try to be as concise as possible), and giving everyone a chance to contribute.

### Lecture Preparation
* Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.
* Proof of practice quiz completion will be checked.
* Members who come unprepared will have that reflected on their peer evaluation scores.

### Attendance
* If you are unable to attend a lecture/tutorial due to an emergency or illness, then this should be communicated to teammates on Instagram 12 hours before or when possible for threatening emergencies.
* Members who are frequently skipping will raise suspicion, and that will be reflected in their peer evaluation scores.

## Decision Making
* Will be decided by a vote. The best case is a unanimous vote. But many times that won't happen. In that case, refer to the ***conflict resolution*** section.
* Will be done as a group, meaning no one gets excluded from decision-making. If someone isn't physically present, then reach out to them online and give them a day to respond before carrying out the decision. (Note that reaching out to people online will waste time, which is why lecture and tutorial attendance are important.)

---
## Conflict resolution

* First, try to reach a compromise.
* If you think your idea is the right one, then prove it (and let's avoid proof by showing why other ideas are wrong, since that involves putting down other teammates).
* If no one can quickly prove why their idea is right, then ask the TA or Prof.
* If there is no TA or Prof and a conflict needs to be quickly resolved, then call on the internet and confirm again with a TA or Prof at a later time.

---

## Accountability

* Teammates should use this contract to keep each other accountable. 
* Stay on top of deadlines and have constant progress on the project. Progress will be evaluated by consistency in relaying information to teammates, branch commit history, and pull requests. This will be reflected in peer evaluation scores.
* Pull requests will be reviewed by the whole team. Merging to the `main` branch will require everyone's approval. 
* To make sure the work is legit, explaining your code is also important. This can be done in tutorials.
* To make sure the code works, demo to teammates once you have finished coding a feature. This can also be done in tutorials. 

---

## Reliability

* To engage the team and also as an extra way to keep people accountable, asking for help from teammates is encouraged. Just make sure not to ask them to do too much. Think of 25% of the task as the suggested max portion of work you can expect.
* If everyone is busy, then TAs are available. Just make sure to get other **humans** to help when you are stuck. (Remember that asking AI to do work is not good.)
